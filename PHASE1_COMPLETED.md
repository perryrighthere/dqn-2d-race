- **Added**: `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies
  - PyTorch for DQN implementation
  - Pygame for visualization
  - Gymnasium for RL environment
  - NumPy and Matplotlib for data processing

### 2. Core Game Environment (`src/environment/`)

#### Circular Track System (`track.py`)
- **Circular Geometry**: Multi-lane circular track with configurable radius and lane count
- **Angular Positioning**: Cars positioned using polar coordinates (angle, radius)
- **Lane Management**: Concentric circular lanes with inner/outer lane changes
- **Middle Lane Protection**: Ensures middle lane stays clear for baseline agent
- **Lap Tracking**: Complete lap detection with angle wrapping

#### Car Physics (`car.py`)
- **Angular Motion**: Cars move using angular velocity around the circular track
- **Lane Changing**: Smooth transitions between concentric lanes
- **BaselineCar**: Fixed angular speed, always stays in middle lane
- **RLCar**: Full physics with angular acceleration, lane changes, and tile interactions
- **Lap Counting**: Automatic lap completion detection

#### Special Tiles System (`special_tiles.py`)
- **Circular Placement**: Tiles positioned at specific angles and radii around track
- **Tile Types**: Acceleration (speed boost) and Deceleration (speed reduction) tiles
- **Angular Collision**: Collision detection using angular distance
- **Lane Restrictions**: Middle lane remains clear for consistent baseline performance
- **State Integration**: Angular-aware tile information for RL agent

#### Circular Visualization (`renderer.py`)
- **Circular Track Rendering**: Concentric circles with lane dividers
- **Polar-to-Screen Conversion**: Proper coordinate transformation for display
- **Car Visualization**: Cars rendered as circles with directional indicators
- **Angular Tile Display**: Special tiles positioned correctly around the track
- **Lap Progress**: Visual lap completion progress bars

#### Race Environment (`race_environment.py`)
- **Lap-Based Racing**: Win condition based on completing required laps (3 by default)
- **Action Space**: 5 discrete actions (stay, inner lane, outer lane, accelerate, decelerate)
- **Angular State Space**: Car state includes angle, angular velocity, and lap progress
- **Circular Reward System**: Rewards based on lap progress and relative performance
- **Timeout Handling**: Race completion by total progress if time limit reached

### 3. Configuration & Testing
- **Game Config**: Centralized parameter configuration (`config/game_config.py`)
- **Demo Script**: Comprehensive testing and visualization demo (`demo.py`)

## ðŸš€ Ready for Phase 2

The circular racing environment is now complete and ready for Phase 2 implementation:

### Next Steps:
1. **Baseline Agent Integration**: Implemented with consistent lap times
2. **DQN Agent Development**: Environment provides angular state/action interface
3. **Training Loop**: Gym-compatible environment for standard RL training
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Lap-based timing and competitive metrics

### Circular Track Interface:
- **State Space**: 17-dimensional (5 car states + 12 angular tile states)
- **Action Space**: 5 discrete actions (stay, inner lane, outer lane, accelerate, decelerate)
- **Reward Function**: Lap progress and competitive performance-based rewards
- **Episode Termination**: First to complete required laps or timeout-based progress

### Racing Mechanics:
- **Track Type**: Circular with radius 300px, 3 concentric lanes
- **Race Format**: 3-lap races for competitive comparison
- **Baseline Consistency**: Middle lane always clear, providing reproducible benchmark times
- **Strategic Elements**: RL agent can use outer/inner lanes with special tiles for advantage

The circular track foundation provides a more realistic racing experience and is extensively tested. Phase 2 can now focus on implementing the DQN algorithm to learn optimal racing strategies around the circular track.
