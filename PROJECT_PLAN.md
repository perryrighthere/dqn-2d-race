# DQN 2D Car Racing Game Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Create a reinforcement learning environment where a DQN agent competes against a baseline agent in a 2D car racing game with multiple lanes and special tiles.

## Core Components & Architecture

### 1. Game Environment Setup
- **Game Engine**: Use Pygame for 2D graphics and game mechanics
- **Environment Structure**: Implement OpenAI Gym-compatible environment
- **Track System**: Multi-lane racing track with configurable length and special tiles
- **Physics**: Simple 2D car movement with position, velocity, and acceleration

### 2. Track Design System
- **Lane Configuration**: Multiple lanes (minimum 3: left, middle, right)
- **Special Tiles**: 
  - Acceleration tiles (boost speed)
  - Deceleration tiles (reduce speed)
  - Randomly distributed in non-middle lanes only
- **Middle Lane Constraint**: Always clear of special tiles for consistent baseline performance

### 3. Agent Implementation
- **Baseline Agent**: 
  - Fixed uniform speed
  - Always stays in middle lane
  - Deterministic behavior for consistent benchmark
- **DQN Agent**:
  - State space: car position, lane, nearby tiles, relative position to baseline
  - Action space: change lanes (left/right/stay), accelerate/decelerate
  - Neural network architecture for Q-value estimation
  - Experience replay and target network

### 4. Training & Evaluation System
- **Reward Function**: Based on race completion time relative to baseline
- **Training Loop**: Episode-based training with performance tracking
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Win rate, average completion time difference
- **Visualization**: Real-time race display and training progress plots

### 5. Required Dependencies
- PyTorch/TensorFlow for DQN implementation
- Pygame for game rendering
- OpenAI Gym for environment structure
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib for training visualization

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Game Environment
1. Set up project dependencies and structure
2. Implement basic 2D racing track with multiple lanes
3. Create car physics and movement mechanics
4. Add special tile system with lane restrictions

### Phase 2: Baseline Agent
1. Implement deterministic baseline agent
2. Ensure consistent performance in middle lane
3. Establish baseline completion time benchmarks

### Phase 3: DQN Agent Framework
1. Design state and action spaces
2. Implement neural network architecture
3. Set up experience replay buffer and training loop
4. Create reward function based on competitive performance

### Phase 4: Training & Competition
1. Train DQN agent against baseline
2. Implement evaluation and visualization systems
3. Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance
4. Generate performance analysis and results

This plan ensures a clean separation between the deterministic baseline (always consistent) and the learning agent (optimizing for competitive advantage through strategic lane changes and special tile usage).
